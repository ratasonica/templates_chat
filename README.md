I've reviewed the account and I noticed that the package has no movement reported since it shipped. This leads me to believe that the package was misplaced in transit to you by the carrier, which I‚Äôm terribly sorry for.
I have tracked your order, and there is no movement on the package at this time. Sometimes this means that the package has been misplaced, but most of the time the package is still on the way but simply has not been scanned at its last location.  
Most packages arrive on time, even if they are missing tracking information. Because the estimated delivery date has not passed, we advise you to wait until the end of day DATE to see if the package arrives.
Because most packages eventually arrive, even if they are a few days late, we'd like to ask if you are able to wait an additional 3 days to see if the original package arrives. If you do not wish to wait, please let us know if you prefer a refund or a replacement.
However, because your estimated delivery date has passed, we can process a refund or a replacement for your item. Which would you prefer?
Unfortunately we do not have any control over the carrier with the delivery.  I can understand how frustrating this is considering you ordered it through us and of course we will try and get your order delivered on or by the date given but the carrier can have delays and that does affect the delivery day.
