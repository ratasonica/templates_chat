And don't worry, there's no further actions needed on your end.
CANCEL PUT

Unfortunately CUSTOMERSNAME, as much as I would love to honor your request and cancel this order, since it was placed to be picked up at the store, the store is the only one that can handle all the processes in it.
I've carefully reviewed my records and I notice that it's a Pickup Today Order and for the quickest resolution it's recommended for you to contact the store directly at (770) 921-9224 and request to cancel the order; this will be the faster way.
I've carefully reviewed your order and the status has not been updated as ready for pickup yet.
I'd also like to explain you that pickup today orders are fulfilled with the store's inventory and only the store is able to update the status. It's recommended for you to contact the store directly at (281) 480-6134 and request an update. And if by any chance they can find your order you they can cancel it.
MARKETPLACE

I've carefully reviewed your order and according to my records the Water Filters were sold and shipped directly by our market place partner: MARKETPLACE
This is a separate retailer that we work with to give you access to a wide variety of additional products that would otherwise not be available to you on our website.   
In this case because the items you received were shipped directly by them, it's recommended for you to contact the Seller directly at NUMBER or send an email to EMAIL.

ALTERNATE

Thank you so much for waiting. I have reviewed all the details in your order, and it appears that there was an error and it did not process correctly in our system, and that's the reason why it could not be shipped when we expected. I deeply apologize for this inconvenience.
This is a very unusual situation, and in an effort to rectify it I have two options for you.
We can either send a cancellation request for this order, or allow a couple of days to see if it ships.
This is not a problem with your account or payment, so if you decide to cancel and reorder this product right now, as a compensation for this inconvenience I can offer you a discount in the new order.
Please tell me, which option would work best for you?

LIT

I have tracked your order, and there is no movement on the package at this time. Sometimes this means that the package has been misplaced, but most of the time the package is still on the way but simply has not been scanned at its last location.  
Most packages arrive on time, even if they are missing tracking information. Because the estimated delivery date has not passed, we advise you to wait until the end of day DATE to see if the package arrives.
Because most packages eventually arrive, even if they are a few days late, we'd like to ask if you are able to wait an additional 3 days to see if the original package arrives. If you do not wish to wait, please let us know if you prefer a refund or a replacement.
However, because your estimated delivery date has passed, we can process a refund or a replacement for your item. Which would you prefer?
