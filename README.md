But in this case because the order was placed today I think will be cancelled.

REMORSE

Thank you so much for waiting. Now I have escalated a request for the selected pick up store to cancel and refund this order, and you should receive further information about this process within 48 hours. 
And don't worry, there's no further actions needed on your end.
CANCEL PUT

Unfortunately CUSTOMERSNAME, as much as I would love to honor your request and cancel this order, since it was placed to be picked up at the store, the store is the only one that can handle all the processes in it.
I've carefully reviewed my records and I notice that it's a Pickup Today Order and for the quickest resolution it's recommended for you to contact the store directly at (770) 921-9224 and request to cancel the order; this will be the faster way.
MARKETPLACE

I've carefully reviewed your order and according to my records the Water Filters were sold and shipped directly by our market place partner: MARKETPLACE
This is a separate retailer that we work with to give you access to a wide variety of additional products that would otherwise not be available to you on our website.   
In this case because the items you received were shipped directly by them, it's recommended for you to contact the Seller directly at NUMBER or send an email to EMAIL.
SAVINGS CATCHER

You can contact our Savings catcher team directly at 866-224-1663.  It's just that they're the only ones with access to your Savings Catcher account, and they handle all the processes about this service. They're very easy to work with, and will be happy to help you.
The Savings catcher team is available Monday through Friday from 7 AM to 5 PM CST, and they’re closed Saturday and Sunday. 

STOP RECHARGE

After reviewing the return tracking information I've verified that the 00000ITEM00000 has been returned as promised, thank you very much for that.
I just have updated the information in the system and we are not to recharge your original payment method. I've stopped the remainders and any notification you could received regarding this matter. If you happen to receive a new email requesting to return your item, please just disregard it.
CHANGES

I’d like to explain you that due to system limitations we cannot make changes on your order after you click “Place Online Order”. In this case It’s recommended for you to cancel the order and reorder with the correct information. I’ll appreciate your understanding. 
STUCK IN PROCESSING

I have carefully gone through our records and I'm afraid to say that I have determined that your order did not process properly due to a problem with our system.  Because I completely understand how much important is for you to receive your ITEM.
I'll also like to explain that we will do our best effort to reprocess this order but if we are unable the order will be cancelled. Please allow up to 48 hours to receive a confirmation either that the order was shipped or that it was cancelled.
I completely understand and we are willing to compensate you either way with a 10% adjustment. As soon as you receive the notification with the resolution please contact us back and provide this REFER.

As soon as your order is shipped you will receive a shipment confirmation email that will include tracking information and expected delivery date.
STUCK IN PROCESSING

I have carefully gone through our records and I'm afraid to say that I have determined that your order did not process properly.  I do apologize for this but because I completely understand how important is for you to receive your order. I've send a request to push the order in the process stage.
I’d also like to explain that we will do our best effort to reprocess your order as fast as we can but if we cannot process it the order will be cancelled. Please allow up to 48 hours to receive a confirmation email either that the order was successfully shipped or that it was cancelled. 
ALTERNATE
Thank you so much for waiting. I have reviewed all the details in your order, and it appears that there was an error and it did not process correctly in our system, and that's the reason why it could not be shipped when we expected. I deeply apologize for this inconvenience.
This is a very unusual situation, and in an effort to rectify it I have two options for you.
We can either send a cancellation request for this order, or allow a couple of days to see if it ships.
This is not a problem with your account or payment, so if you decide to cancel and reorder this product right now, as a compensation for this inconvenience I can offer you a discount in the new order.
Please tell me, which option would work best for you?
